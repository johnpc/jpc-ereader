# LocalStorage Features Documentation

## Overview

The JPC E-Reader now includes comprehensive localStorage functionality to save reading progress, settings, and history. Users can seamlessly resume reading where they left off, and their preferences are preserved across sessions.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 📚 **Reading Progress Tracking**
- **Automatic Progress Saving**: Reading position and percentage are automatically saved as you read
- **Resume Reading**: Books automatically open to your last reading position
- **Visual Progress Indicators**: Book cards show reading progress with circular progress bars
- **Continue Reading Badge**: Books with progress display a "Continue Reading" badge
- **Last Read Timestamps**: Shows when you last read each book ("2 hours ago", "Yesterday", etc.)

### ⚙️ **Settings Management**
- **Global Settings**: Default reading preferences (font size, theme, etc.)
- **Book-Specific Settings**: Individual books can have their own custom settings
- **Automatic Persistence**: All settings changes are automatically saved
- **Settings Inheritance**: New books inherit global settings, but can be customized per book

### 📖 **Reading History**
- **Recently Read Books**: Tracks the last 50 books you've opened
- **Chronological Order**: Most recently read books appear first
- **Reading Statistics**: Shows progress percentage and last read time
- **Quick Access**: Easy navigation back to recently read books

### 💾 **Data Management**
- **Storage Usage Monitoring**: Track how much localStorage space is being used
- **Data Export/Import**: Backup and restore your reading data
- **Selective Data Clearing**: Remove progress for specific books
- **Storage Optimization**: Efficient data structures to minimize storage usage

## 🎯 **User Experience Enhancements**

### Book Library View
- **Progress Indicators**: Circular progress bars on book covers show completion percentage
- **Visual Distinction**: Books with progress have blue borders and special styling
- **Continue Reading**: Clear indication of which books can be resumed
- **Smart Sorting**: Books with recent progress appear more prominently

### Reader Experience
- **Seamless Resume**: Books automatically open to your saved location
- **Progress Persistence**: Reading position is saved every time you navigate
- **Settings Memory**: Each book remembers your preferred reading settings
- **Cross-Session Continuity**: Progress is maintained across browser sessions

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Storage Service (`storageService.ts`)
```typescript
// Save reading progress
storageService.saveBookProgress(bookId, location, progress);

// Get saved progress
const progress = storageService.getBookProgress(bookId);

// Save book-specific settings
storageService.saveBookSettings(bookId, settings);

// Get reading history
const history = storageService.getReadingHistory();
```

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface BookProgress {
  bookId: string;
  location: string;        // CFI (Canonical Fragment Identifier)
  progress: number;        // Percentage (0-1)
  lastRead: string;        // ISO timestamp
  currentPage?: number;
  totalPages?: number;
  chapterTitle?: string;
}
```

### Storage Keys
- `jpc-ereader-progress`: Book reading progress
- `jpc-ereader-book-settings`: Book-specific settings
- `jpc-ereader-global-settings`: Global default settings
- `jpc-ereader-history`: Reading history

## 📱 **Components Enhanced**

### BookCard Component
- **Progress Overlay**: Circular progress indicator on book covers
- **Continue Reading Badge**: Visual indicator for books with progress
- **Last Read Time**: Human-readable timestamps ("2 hours ago")
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Screen reader support for progress information

### Reader Component
- **Auto-Resume**: Automatically navigates to saved reading position
- **Progress Tracking**: Continuously saves reading position as you navigate
- **Settings Persistence**: Remembers and applies book-specific settings

### useReader Hook
- **Storage Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with localStorage service
- **Progress Management**: Handles saving and retrieving reading progress
- **Settings Synchronization**: Manages global and book-specific settings

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### Opening a Book with Progress
```typescript
// When opening a book, the reader automatically:
// 1. Loads saved progress
// 2. Applies book-specific settings (or global defaults)
// 3. Navigates to the saved reading position
// 4. Adds the book to reading history

const openBook = async (book: Book) => {
  await epubService.loadBook(book);
  const savedProgress = storageService.getBookProgress(book.id);
  
  if (savedProgress?.location) {
    await rendition.display(savedProgress.location); // Resume where left off
  } else {
    await rendition.display(); // Start from beginning
  }
};
```

### Saving Progress
```typescript
// Progress is automatically saved when navigating
const updateProgress = (location: string, progress: number) => {
  storageService.saveBookProgress(bookId, location, progress);
};
```

### Managing Settings
```typescript
// Settings can be global or book-specific
const updateSettings = (newSettings: Partial<ReaderSettings>) => {
  // Save as global default
  storageService.saveGlobalSettings(updatedSettings);
  
  // Also save for current book if reading
  if (currentBook) {
    storageService.saveBookSettings(currentBook, updatedSettings);
  }
};
```

## 📊 **Storage Management**

### Storage Usage
```typescript
const usage = storageService.getStorageUsage();
console.log(`Using ${usage.percentage}% of available storage`);
```

### Data Export/Import
```typescript
// Export all data
const backupData = storageService.exportData();

// Import data
const success = storageService.importData(backupData);
```

### Clear Data
```typescript
// Clear all app data
storageService.clearAllData();

// Remove progress for specific book
storageService.removeBookProgress(bookId);
```

## 🔒 **Privacy & Security**

- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored locally in the browser
- **No Server Communication**: Reading progress never leaves your device
- **User Control**: Users can clear their data at any time
- **No Personal Information**: Only book IDs and reading positions are stored

## 🎨 **Visual Indicators**

### Progress Indicators
- **Circular Progress Bars**: Show completion percentage on book covers
- **Color Coding**: Blue theme for books with progress
- **Percentage Display**: Exact progress percentage shown
- **Hover Effects**: Enhanced visual feedback

### Continue Reading
- **Badge System**: Clear "Continue Reading" indicators
- **Time Stamps**: Human-readable last read times
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Books with progress are visually prioritized

## 🔄 **Future Enhancements**

### Planned Features
- **Bookmarks Integration**: Save and sync bookmarks with localStorage
- **Reading Statistics**: Track reading time, pages per session, etc.
- **Reading Goals**: Set and track reading goals
- **Notes and Highlights**: Save annotations locally
- **Sync Across Devices**: Optional cloud sync for reading progress

### Potential Improvements
- **Compression**: Compress stored data to save space
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old progress data
- **Analytics**: Reading pattern analysis and insights
- **Backup Reminders**: Prompt users to backup their data

## 🧪 **Testing the Features**

### How to Test
1. **Open a book** and read a few pages
2. **Close the reader** and return to the library
3. **Notice the progress indicator** on the book cover
4. **Reopen the book** - it should resume where you left off
5. **Change settings** while reading - they should persist
6. **Check reading history** for recently read books

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Books show progress indicators after reading
- ✅ Books automatically resume at saved position
- ✅ Settings are remembered per book
- ✅ Reading history tracks recently opened books
- ✅ Progress persists across browser sessions
- ✅ Visual indicators clearly show reading status

## 📈 **Performance Impact**

- **Minimal Overhead**: Efficient storage operations
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking storage reads/writes
- **Optimized Data**: Compact data structures
- **Smart Caching**: Reduced redundant storage operations

The localStorage integration provides a seamless, persistent reading experience while maintaining excellent performance and user privacy!
